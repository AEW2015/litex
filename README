[> Intro
---------
LiteX is a fork of Migen/MiSoC for our own needs at Enjoy-Digital. It provides
a single python package and add some specific features to design our FPGA cores,
build a SoC with or or load/flash it to the hardware.

The structure of LiteX is kept close to Migen/MiSoC to enable collaboration
between projects.

[> License
-----------
LiteX is copyright (c) 2015 Enjoy-Digital.

git history to get correct ownership of files.

[> Sub-packages
-----------
gen:
  Provides tools and simple modules to generate HDL.

build:
  Provides tools to build FPGA bitstreams (interface to vendor toolchains) and to
  simulate HDL code or full SoCs.

soc:
  Provides definitions/modules to build cores (bus, bank, flow), cores and tools
  to build a SoC from such cores.

boards:
  Provides platforms and targets for the supported boards.
